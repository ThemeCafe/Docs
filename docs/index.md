### About Theme Café

*I started this project cause I felt like Wii U was lacking something that all the other consoles had... Themes!, I wanted to make something similar to what the 3DS Community had achieved, so for the past few months I have tried my best to get there and today, I can proudly say that with the help of the community we have achieved that point and even better, we can go even further!*
