# Themiify

!!! abstract "Credits to [Nathaniel](https://github.com/Fangal-Airbag) and [AlphaCraft](https://github.com/AlphaCraft9658) for creating this app"

Themiify is a homebrew application that allows for on the fly installation of Wii U System Menu themes without the need for users to use external tools like Rom Patcher JS to get their theme files.

Themiify searches `SD:/wiiu/themes` for Wii U Theme Archive files (`.utheme`) and installs the contents of the theme archive as an SDCafiine modpack. Once a theme is installed a user can select it via the SDCafiine modpack selector.

!!! info "**No system file is modified by this app.**"

## What you need

- A modded Wii U with [Aroma](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/aroma/getting-started.html)
- [Themiify](#) *Link to github releases*
- [SDCafiine Plugin](https://github.com/wiiu-env/sdcafiine_plugin/releases)
- Your theme with the extension `.utheme` 

??? question "About the use of SDCafiine"

    SDCafiine works by loading themes safely via the SD Card. Themiify installs the files on the SD Card for SDCafiine to load, if you do not have the [SDCafiine Plugin](https://github.com/wiiu-env/sdcafiine_plugin/releases) installed, no changes will be made and you will not see any custom theme
