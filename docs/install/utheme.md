# Utheme

Utheme is a homebrew application that allows for on the fly installation of Wii U System Menu themes without the need for users to use external tools, and allows to browse and install themes directly from the internet to your console. Once a theme is installed [StyleMiiU-Plugin](https://github.com/Themiify-hb/StyleMiiU-Plugin/releases) will read the theme and show it next time the Wii U Menu is loaded.
