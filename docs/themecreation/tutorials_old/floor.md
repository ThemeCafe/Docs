2. Open **LoungeFloor**
3. Open **Textures**
4. Now on these step you will need an image editing software, i like using **GIMP**

    You can use [this xcf file](files/floorgimp2_1.xcf) to customize the colors of the floor you want

    You can use GIMP to open it and then modify it by layers

    If you dont know how to use GIMP you may want to watch a tutorial on youtube or something

5. When you are done editing your image **export** it as a png into anywhere on your pc, we will save it for now

6. Open switch toolbox again, right click **Floor_Alb** and then replace it with the floor you just made
