If the information does not match, follow [JNUSTool](install/files.md#jnustool) to get your original files again

If the information matches with the one from your files and you're still getting the Source ROM checksum mismatch error, it might be a bad patch, you can try applying the patch anyways or use another theme

--------------

## Black Screen

Either the patch that you used was a bad patch or the Theme is too heavy for the console to handle

You can

- Patch the files again
- Check the size of the file
- If your console is EUR, check if the Theme is compatible with that region

If it doesn't work and the console is still showing a black screen you can try

- On the SDCafiine screen, press B to launch without a modpack
- Delete your theme from `sd:/wiiu/sdcafiine/[TITLEID]/[ThemeName]`
- Deleting the plugin `SD:/wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins/sdcafiine.wps`.

--------------

## Freezing

Something is wrong with the cafe_barista_men.bfsar

Either

- Your music is too long
- Your music is too heavy
- The file was not patched correctly

You can

- Patch the files again
- Check the size of the file
- If the song used is too long, try making it shorter

--------------

## Loading Indefinitely (StyleMiiU-Plugin)

If your console is loading indefinitely, something is wrong with your Men.pack, Men2.pack files

You can

- Patch the files again
- Check the size of the file
- If your console is EUR, check if the Theme is compatible with that region

If it doesn't work and the console is still loading indefinitely you can try

- Deleting your theme `sd:/wiiu/themes/[ThemeName]`
- Deleting the plugin `SD:/wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins/stylemiiu.wps`.

--------------

## Theme not loading

The files were not loaded correctly/no modifications were made

You can

- Check that you patched the file correctly
- Check that you are using the correct path
    - SDCafiine: `sd:/wiiu/sdcafiine/[TITLEID]/[ThemeName]/content/Common/Package/Men.pack, Men2.pack`
    - StyleMiiU: `sd:/wiiu/themes/[ThemeName]/content/Common/Package/Men.pack, Men2.pack`
