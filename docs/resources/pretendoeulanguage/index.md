### Description: 

This patch replaces all instances of "Nintendo Network" with "Pretendo Network"

For the system language you are using, you will need the default AllMessage.szs file. This can be obtained by using the [ftpiiu plugin](../../install/files.md#__tabbed_1_1). Once you've gotten the original language file/s, you will need to apply the relevant patch for your language.

Finally, you will want to place the patched language file in the content folder of your current theme. (content/LANGUAGE/Message/AllMessage.szs) 
Instead of "LANGUAGE", name the folder whichever language you want to replace (image above for reference)
